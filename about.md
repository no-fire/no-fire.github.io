##Introducing Us, _We Didn't Start the Fire_
We're a team of three sophomores at Olin College of Engineering, in Needham MA. Project Memory was created for the Spring 2017 iteration of Computational Robotics, as taught by [Paul Ruvolo](https://github.com/paulruvolo/comprobo17).

Your project must involve a robot!  While this seems obvious, one place where things get fuzzy is if your project is primarily about developing a system that has multiple uses (one of which is for robotics).  In this case, you will be expected to deploy your module on a robot by the end of the project.
Your project should, except in very rare cases, involve the Neatos.  I will consider working with other robots only when you can convincingly show that bringing the new platform online will not take a significant portion of the project time.
The project should involve (in part) learning about a robotics algorithm.  This is not only about creating a great demo, you must structure your project so that you learn about a robotics algorithm in a project-based manner.
The project work should primarily be computational.  Some amount of electrical / mechanical work is fine, but it should be a fairly minimal portion of the project.


##The Motivation
